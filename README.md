# How it works
1. Shuffle a deck of playing cards
2. Place a deck of playing cards on a flat surface
3. The person who places the cards down goes first
4. The person will flip over the top card
5. Use the "Symbols and Descriptions" section to determine the conversation starter based on the card flipped
6. Use the Suite and then Card Number

# Example
Joe shuffles the deck and places it on the table. He then flips over the top card which turns out to reveal a nine of clubs. Joe would then look check the "Symbols and Descriptions" and find that the club represents "Work" and nine represents "Favitore Food/Meal". Joe can now start a conversation to talk about a time his life where a meal either at work or work related meal left a favorable impression on him. 

John can add to the conversation to include his story or inquire more about the meal or work to continue the conversation going. 

If Joe and John run out of things on the top and the awkward silence appears, John can turn over the top card and repeat the process.

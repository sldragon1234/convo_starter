# How it works
Shuffle a deck of playing cards
Place a deck of playing cards on a flat surface
The person who places the cards down goes first
The person will flip over the top card
Use the "Symbols and Descriptions" section to determine the conversation starter based on the card flipped
Use the Suite and then Card Number

# Example
Joe suffles the deck and places it on the table. He then flips over the top card which turns out to reveal a nine of clubs. Joe would then look check the "Symbols and Descriptions" and find that the club represents "Work" and nine reprents "Favitore Food/Meal". Joe can now start a conversation to talk about a time his life were a meal either by doing work or at work left a favorable impression on him. 

John can add to the conversation to include his story or inquire more about the meal or work to continue the conversation going. 

If Joe and John run out of things on the top and the awkard silence appears, John can turn over the top card and repeat the process.
